When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when I'm working with others on a code base or project
- when I'm working on a code base or project from multiple machines
- when I want a backup of my code base or project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- I may want to decide when commit my changes to my remote repository as I make changes to the code locally.
