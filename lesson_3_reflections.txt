When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when I'm working with others on a code base or project
- when I'm working on a code base or project from multiple machines
- when I want a backup of my code base or project

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- forks copy the code and create a repo in my GitHub account- changes aren't tracked in the original
- clones are made between my GitHub repo and my local machine and updates between them are tracked
- branches are tracked on both my local machine and in GitHub
